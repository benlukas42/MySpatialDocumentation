# My Spatial Documentation

I made this documentation because at the time Spatial's own documentation was a bit lackluster.
You can find Spatial's documentation [here](https://docs.spatial.io/).



### Creating Spaces

Covers the process of getting a Spatial project up and running.

### Objects for Spatial

Covers creating objects for Spatial projects. Also covers the different types of Spatial objects that are added in the Creator Toolkit.

### Scipts for Spatial

Only covers creating Visual Scripts in Unity for Spatial projects[^1].

[^1]: This was made when Spatial did not support C# scripting (which they now do support).
